# Fleddit-API

Welcome to Fleddit, a blog website where you can share your ideas and comments! The Fleddit API was built using Ruby on Rails.

In order to use this app, you will also need the [Fleddit-Client](https://github.com/anikonchuk/fleddit-client), which is available at https://github.com/anikonchuk/fleddit-client.

## Installation

Download this repository. From the terminal (in the project directory), run ```bundle install``` to install gem dependencies. Then, run ```rails db:migrate``` to set up the database. Run ```rails s``` to start a web server for the API. You will also need the front-end Fleddit-Client. See instructions in the [Fleddit-Client repository](https://github.com/anikonchuk/fleddit-client).
